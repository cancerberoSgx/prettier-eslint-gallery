# Objectives

 * have tools that let users format their code using popular eslint like standard, airbnb, uber, etc. ideally online
 * have a cmd formatter tool that formats to popular eslints

# Nice to have

 * acept custom eslint - like for security - performance... 

# issues / TODOS

 * we are installing all the eslint plugins in the same project - but i notice that standard and airbnb require particular versions of plugins and they could be incompatible... try to separate individual projects in

  * https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-config-xo
  * https://github.com/dustinspecker/awesome-eslint
  * https://github.com/walmartlabs/eslint-config-defaults
  * https://github.com/FormidableLabs/eslint-config-formidable


  then there are other that has nothing to do with style but with performance , security - should investigate:
